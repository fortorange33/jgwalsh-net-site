      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>James Gregory Walsh</strong>, though I often go by Greg. I hold a strong foundation in mental health counseling, with over five years of experience collaborating closely with psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers to support vulnerable populations. This interdisciplinary experience has shaped my approach to public service and fuels my current pursuit of a career in federal or state law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
        My academic background includes graduate-level training in applied clinical psychology, emphasizing both theoretical insight and hands-on practice. I’ve developed complementary analytical competencies through the use of tools like <strong>SPSS, R, and Excel</strong> — skills that are vital for investigative work, risk assessment, and data-informed decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to integrate these dual competencies — human empathy and statistical reasoning — into roles centered on <em>public safety, crisis management, and behavioral threat evaluation</em>. Whether through enforcement, prevention, or analysis, I aim to contribute meaningfully to mission-driven organizations dedicated to justice, resilience, and civic protection.
